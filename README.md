# PySparkProjects

Some of the PySpark files reference SQL functions from SQL server and PostgreSQL. See the SQL Functions folder for those functions..

See File Examples for the tables and files some PySPark functions reference. Please note the data in the files is not real data. It is simplified data just to show how the functions will work with the data.
